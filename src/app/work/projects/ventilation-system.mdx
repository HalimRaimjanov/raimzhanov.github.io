## Overview

In this project, I developed a website for a ventilation company that specializes in the sale and installation of ventilation systems for both homes and businesses. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional online presence that highlights the company’s products and services while providing a user-friendly experience.

## Key Features
- **Product Catalog: Created dynamic product cards that display detailed information about the ventilation systems, including specifications and pricing.
- **Multi-page Design: Designed and implemented a website with over five pages, each focused on different aspects of the company’s services, such as product offerings, installation guides, and customer support.
- **Animations: Added smooth animations throughout the website to enhance the user experience and create a visually engaging interface.
- **Responsive Layout: Ensured that the website is fully responsive, offering an optimized experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **jQuery: Used for creating interactive elements and handling user interactions smoothly.
- **HTML & CSS: Built the structure and design of the website, ensuring it was clean, responsive, and visually appealing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges was ensuring the website was both functional and aesthetically pleasing, without compromising performance. By integrating animations and interactive elements, I had to optimize for speed and smoothness to avoid performance issues.

## Outcome

The website successfully meets the client’s needs, providing them with a professional online presence that effectively showcases their products and services. The animations and responsive design contribute to a seamless and engaging user experience, improving customer interaction with the brand.
