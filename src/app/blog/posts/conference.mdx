This May, I had the chance to attend **Firebird Conference 2025** in Moscow — and it turned out to be one of the most inspiring professional experiences I’ve had in a long time.

## A Community That Builds the Future

What struck me the most wasn’t just the technical content — although that was excellent — but the people. Developers, architects, engineers, and database experts from all over, exchanging ideas, discussing real-world challenges, and thinking ahead about the future of Firebird.

The upcoming **Firebird 6.0**, which is set to be released next year, was a major topic. It was exciting to hear what’s coming: performance improvements, security enhancements, and architectural changes that could impact how many companies work with data in the near future.

## Earning the Certificate

One personal milestone: I passed the certification exam and officially became a **certified Firebird Database Administrator**. It was challenging, but also a great way to validate the years of experience I’ve built working with databases.

## New Ideas, New Energy

Beyond the sessions and technical talks, what I’m bringing home is energy. Motivation. New ideas. When you’re surrounded by professionals who care deeply about what they do, it’s hard not to feel inspired.

Sometimes all it takes to reboot your thinking is to leave your usual environment, meet people who love the same tools you do, and remind yourself why you got into tech in the first place.

Firebird Conference 2025 was exactly that.
